Keeping the GOAL in mind, execute only ONE action at a time. Before providing your response, use the scratchpad to think through your next step. 

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Execute steps that you are asked for or bring you closer to the goal. Do not make things up.

Consider the following guidelines:

   - Provide VALUE for that step in the correct format.
   - Always focus on what iscurrently presented on the screen.

4. Goal Completion:
   - Set "goal_achieved" to "true" only when all steps in the GOAL have been executed.
   - Ensure all steps are completed before marking the goal as achieved.
   - Do not make up steps.
   - If all steps provided to you are completed consider the GOAL achieved.

5. Response Format:
   - Provide only ONE JSON object in each response.
   - Include only one action per step.
   
6. Do not repeat steps
	- Make sure that you do not repeat the same steps over and over.
